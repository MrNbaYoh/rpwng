# RPwnG
RPwnG is a 3ds userland exploit for RPG Maker Player, allowing one to launch
[the Homebrew Launcher](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/) through the game.
## Requirements
You'll need :  
* a 3ds on firmware <= 11.5
* a digital copy of [RPG Maker Player](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rpg-maker-player-3ds) (free)

## Installation
1. Get and install the homebrew starter kit available [here](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/).
2. Find a code for your region and console type (o3ds/n3ds). You might want to look at #GetRPwnG on twitter.
3. Download the project thank to the online sharing feature, once the download is finished try to run it.
4. Enjoy!

## How to use RPwnG
Just try to load the RPwnG game, the loading should stop and the HBL should run.  
/!\ It might take a while for the exploit to run, be patient /!\

## Thanks
* [smealum](https://github.com/smealum) and everyone else who have contributed to the HBL/hax payload
* All the potential testers and the people who share the exploit

## Donations  
Much efforts and time have been spent on making this exploit, since some people already asked me if they could give me a few bucks somewhere, I decided for the first time to add this donation button.  
Of course you're not forced to give anything, every amount will be appreciated and of course used for hacking purposes ;) (potentially Switchhax in the future)
